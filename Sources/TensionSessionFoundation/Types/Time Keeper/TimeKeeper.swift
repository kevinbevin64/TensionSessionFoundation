// MARK: - Plan
/// TimeKeeper role: Act as either a stopwatch or a timer, executing a closure when a provided
/// alert duration has elapsed.
///
/// Functions:
///   - resume: starts or continues the TimeKeeper
///   - pause: pauses the TimeKeeper
///   - reset: resets the values of the TimeKeeper
///
/// Variables:
///   - public timeDisplay
///   - private timeElapsed = .zero
///   - private startTime (optional)
///   - private lastPausedTime (optional)
///   - private pauseDuration = .zero
///
/// Idea:
///   - Keep track of the start time
///     - So, I need a startTime that is an optional Date
///   - Update the timeDisplay every time I check the time
///     - timeDisplay gets its information from the difference between the current time and the
///       start time
///   - Handling pausing
///     - In addition to the timeDisplay which keeps track of the amount of time spent while the
///       TimeKeeper was running, we have a pauseDuration which tracks the amount of time spent
///       while in a paused state. To calculate timeDisplay, we do:
///           Date.now - startTime - pauseDuration
///     - We also need a lastPausedTime, so that when the timer is resumed again, we can can add the
///       difference between the current time and last paused time to the pauseDuration, which
///       can then be used in the calculation of timeDisplay
///       - Because time display displays either a stopwatch or timer, and I want to always know
///         the stopwatch time, there will be a private variable, timeElapsed
///
///   - Handling stopping
///     - When the time is stopped, then then we save the elapsed time to the timeElapsed variable
///
///   - Handling resetting
///     - Set the timeElapsed to 0, make startTime nil, make lastPausedTime nil,
///
///   - Main implementation:
///     - When the TimeKeeper is resumed, start a Task that updates the timeElapsed value every
///       50 milliseconds (20 times a second)
///     - when the TimeKeepr is paused, stop that Task
///     - when the TimeKeeper is stopped, stop/kill(?) that Task
///
